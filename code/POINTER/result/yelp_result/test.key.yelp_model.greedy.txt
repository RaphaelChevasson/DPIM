ever go to vegas for couples full foot massage and full foot massage . when you walk in the door they don t let one person enter the restroom , even if music is playing just outside the door you can barely hear it . best massage for my life ! .
worked with meredith and lana and she was amazing as well . i have been so impressed with how they ran so smoothly . they handled both of my clients both on a same day and on the same day as the wedding ! .
nice movie theatre , it is inside the old portuguese colony fashion square . they now have of multiple theatres for different sizes people . the screens are comfortable and sound and screen was good and clean just how small theatre is there is plenty of parking nearby .

what a pleasure to work with ken and the whole team . i know they were a bit short handed , but they were all still working well together for my art project seriously . the baked goods are absolutely delicious and i will be stopping here every time i m in town .
love this location , however , i only seem to frequent several of it when i am in pittsburgh . but overall this one is pretty standard starbucks that is just like any other starbucks chain . the staff are always nice and well thought out of place ! .
gold spike is always a great way to spend some time playing with some old school crowd . the girls there are super fun and they re very friendly . cool atmosphere but it is not loud or visual pleasing but if you don t want to deal , highly recommended ! .
great beer . we enjoyed the beer here . the atmosphere is perfect for watching the game we had been playing football til this day , my husband and i loved it and the beer we had a good experience a few times here ! .
it is just so expensive compared to all the other places in nyc and new york city and they re always not up to par here . the mango and banana split are amazing . not bad either ! .
these guys fixed my ceiling fan in a timely , efficient , professional and efficient manner . they are dukes of air . they also performed the necessary work on the house when the said needed . they did some of their earlier work . highly recommended ! .
used to love this place because the friendly customer service was good . the prices for the drinks have been raised since , now they might just not removed certain products no charge which i buy free of charge . and their popcorn is so good ! .
they were able to accommodate me and were able to accommodate every customer that they have . store neat , clean and convenient . i am very impressed with their work and the people who work there you . thank you guys so much . ! .
took myself and my girlfriend here to grab a quick night with a cold drink . i ordered a red bull , a white chocolate and an iced tea , which she assured me to barely watered and put any alcohol in my drink . highly recommend ! .
this is a great place to go but these thugs and ignorant acts of people . they just basically do their energy about your body and injury . they didn t warn in the beginning . i can t advise you to move or you may not worth the injury or your body ! .
this is my favorite restaurant . it was absolutely amazing . they are so incredibly spicy that it literally blew our minds . they are so authentic and just sublime . among the best restaurants in pittsburgh . such a hidden gem in pittsburgh . ! .
the breakfast here is so delicious . for breakfast is a perfect spot to grab a quick bite and some coffee with starbucks next door . the wings are my favorite . i prefer casual pants because they re not priced too much comparable to anywhere in nyc .
this is just so cool with its fun atmosphere . we love sitting in the patio behind the bar and having a great time couples , hanging out , and talking like crazy and laughing all night until we re drunk . our bartender and she was terrific ! .
awful . i used to eat here and went here every week quite frequently , i m not sorry for the positive reviews , but what a bad experience once . we have we actually not eaten there at least one occasion . my experience with my wife today was just disappointing as well .
quality products at a great price , excellent customer service . one or two boxes . there are plenty of places to stick on one side of the puzzle pieces . it is easy to pick only one piece or just stack with all of them .
we have just moved here and just wanted to grab a quick slice of pizza somewhere close to my house and we decided to check out a new place out . well i just say the pizza rev had the best thing that i don t like is the combo ! .
such a cute little ice cheese and cream and soda shop . adorable . lots of awesome homemade ice cream cones with unique flavors . owner is super sweet employees are nice and helpful and loyal customers . ! .
this food for a typical chain but it is so fresh and so good . you don t have to forget to check out their sugar free dessert option , it is also a great deal . i had the mint for the chicken one and it was fantastic as well ! .
a small , but a cute store . very passionate about the ice cream and what ice cream stands out . this place is the perfect location and a nice place to spend an afternoon exploring downtown choices in central phoenix area ! .
pretty good food . i wish they were vegetarian and offered way more rice then they had my usual all you can get lunch buffet which was decent but has a lunch menu with some interesting items . didn t find it to be better indian food in the strip ! .
this is definitely not your average mexican restaurant , not bad . the food was good , but at a little high end for the quality . for that price my wife enjoyed her steak , it was way too fatty and had some fat . my youngest son enjoys the meals here .
love this place . i am lucky enough to have found this little coffee which is the best , most authentic coffee i have found . these guys are awesome , they make their own coffee literally and they know their stuff . can t go wrong with these guys ! .
another great experience . mike was awesome . i was buying my son such a new car and all of mike was awesome and very helpful in the feeding him . we had a few questions and if you live in gilbert they will definitely help you make the decision . thanks ! .

excellent food in a fun atmosphere . the breakfast menu is delicious . all the dishes are presented well and the presentation is beautiful beautifully . i m not a big fan of their french toast but great for a new date night place ! .
pizza is excellent . from pizza to wings . delivery is always on time . pizza is great , but the pizza will seal the deal for it . i had a good experience . it wasn t too high and ultimately not a good experience .
awesome place , love it . best italian beef in cleveland , but honestly the other sandwiches are amazing , i recommend . i guess it is a little slow for lunch but worth the wait and great spot ! .

took my husband out to buy one yesterday . the people are friendly and we both love our cars and they have a great price for hardware and they were able to match my quote and i can beat the price and it can t beat the price ! .
i have been so thrilled when we finally tried it and i am glad we found a new spot . for mexican , this might be the best restaurant . it is totally worth the drive . it is nice to see so many different options ! .
this little pub has a limited seating but excellent beer selection , but their prices are pretty steep , especially in the middle of nowhere , if on the main road . but a good flavour for the price ! .
awesome place and they are open late at night . a popular spot . great service and food . service is fast . food is good . but a little greasy . it means you could eat next door across the restaurant but again , the food is worth it ! .
service is usually pretty good . large portion , huge portions and fast service . also quite good and very inexpensive considering the price as it saves me from a full belly ache . have always leave satisfied and this is my favorite home cooked meal . thanks guys ! .
we have had some issues and they were able to treat and reverse the situation if i wouldn t called into detail but i was very pleased that they were able to correct the problems and i am glad found them . will recommend to friends , family and friends ! .
this place has really cool and has creative menu . have nightly lunch specials . they have some of the most good fresh ingredients . you can add rice which is nice . small menu but the portions are very big and their prices are just right ! .
the service here is beyond terrible , the managers are looking on their faces how horrible customer service . the food was horrible , my mom and two friends didn t order a single dish , and we were trying to find people because there was too many people here . ! .
i absolutely love this show . it remains one of my favorite in vegas . mac king is a perfect combination of stunts , stunts , incredible dancing , and great dance . wow . this show is the interaction with the audience throughout the show . highly recommend ! .
this place has really great service and they are the only authentic jamaican restaurant . they don t have mexican style , just some of the other food places . their jerk chicken and sour soup are also very nice people too ! .
great buffet is such a nice restaurant , they have fair to low prices . they have lots of delicious foods and have plenty of choices of sides . you will usually leave full of cold , fresh seafood or vegetables . satisfying meals overall ! .
i had the thai milk and it is really good . smooth and not too creamy . my friend ordered the pad thai and it was cold , but it was still hot when they added more of coconut milk to make a regular tea . delicious ! .
i really like this location , it reminds me do it too low rent so glad i did . overall rating is a four but the quality of food there is still very good . friendly servers are also very friendly , restaurant was clean inside restaurant ! .
i love , love authentic mexican restaurant . because there are so many restaurants out here and in las vegas that there are lots to choose from , all but as for the food and the people here . it is fantastic . they have great service as well ! .
hands down the best red jade i have ever been to . this restaurant is owned by a chinese owner , a refreshing change . from your pork chop , mongolian beef , and the jade red chicken , you won t be disappointed ! .
this is a very competent and caring medical professional . my only flaw in his practice is that he does not like to interact with the doctors specialists or other specific specialty cases instead of seeing patients in a group setting in which his patients are insane . there is no other choice other than this one .
love their new menu . drinks are good , me , my husband and buddy always have some friends with us to chill out and enjoy late night here . but i would recommend the bae to either alone or here for a night of the go ! .
i was in town for a wedding band and they had a gig at this spot last weekend . my cut guy is the tattoo artist who cuts my hair like a master barber . he is cool dude and his cuts are fast , affordable ! .
this place is so delicious . i was on susan chang and decided to give it a chance after reading other reviews and glad we did . i had the purple rice and they didn t skip on the salt either . we definitely will be going back ! .

love that i finally found amazing almond cookies with my boyfriend . i . this restaurant is a tiny little location , but it is a gem . the homemade pasta was delicious and the delivery was timely . it was outstanding .
not sure why this is . real authentic mexican restaurant and very unique . very good food . for any time of the day , breakfast or lunch , sit in one of their booths at the bar and can t wait hours at the bar as they are always so busy which is great ! .
very disappointed . my husband and i were looking for good indian cuisine so decided to eat american style and we were not impressed with our food . we did not understand the other reviews about this restaurant but it was a disappointment since we do not have many other indian places in our area .
most good steak i have ever tasted . the restaurant is beautiful and i would definitely go back to meet the manager for a business event . never had a bad experience . it wasn t exactly expecting very fancy dining establishment but they were not busy at all ! .
went here to watch the ufc on a friday and saturday night . it was packed . not a large poker room , but drinks were . diverse venue that handles the crowd on a thursday and saturday evening at this venue .
i was in vegas with a friend to visit me . our friend took great care of us , ensuring everything was perfect my glass was very full and satisfied at my meal the french toast she had . it just arrived , it was warm and delicious . highly recommend ! .
very good stuff . the jerk chicken was not at all too salty about it , not a fan of jerk chicken kind of lacked a unique profile to it , but still had a great flavor nonetheless . my wife really enjoyed her benedict , also very good .
the staff is friendly professional . they are very careful with how clean everything they do my pup had a fur babies just for my mom and her baby girl and he did a great job . and the fur babies treats me like a new baby from now on ! .
we love this wonderful school . it truly has the most amazing teachers . the teachers are truly like an extension of the children of our family . not familiar with this location , they are dedicated , caring , compassionate and understanding . this school is a milestone in my educational journey .

i m such a southern boy and i am so glad that we stopped here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised . it wasn t as good as i don t remember but this place every chance to make it happen in las vegas ! .
our waiter was very nice recommended dishes . i had a peruvian bowl and my friend had the fried chicken . it was dry . the potato french dip was sweet potato fries in they were not that good . the quality could be improved on the price though .
if you can t go wrong with this if you are a huge fan of the fucking stupid telephone line and every phone in the reservation booth so it is all dark grey granite and a forest of shadows . aka : whoever is all that , mean evil af . avoid instead .
at border grill sometimes has a pretty consistent experience here . very good american mexican food is ok , but they are very fair for the quality , taste and price . also a nice sports bar , with both indoor and outdoor seating as well ! .
i can t say enough great things , they did such a great team . we had them remove some granite and in and i worked with a tech to mark out an estimate for repair and i highly recommend these guys , they are rock solid . awesome job guys ! .
my wife and i eat here at least once or twice a month , we realize this place is a locally owned store , everything is made in house here . they are very good and the atmosphere is good too . i always have happy here ! .
i will not ever return to this establishment again . they are lazy , slow . they are full of teenagers so i wasn t be on them running around and all over the restaurant , making my burger any better than going home . ! .
the manager casey was so helpful and always going the extra mile . he goes the extra mile to help make us feel like we we re safe . highly recommended ! .
this is now my go to for indian restaurant . the best indian food in all of old town , and by far the best buffet hands down . its not too bad here thank you lord for blessings the owner , rani , rani , gill , are awesome ! .
nice theater but the prices are just a slightly higher than that of typical of amc , except , they do have some pretty strong . so far it is very good , will stay again .
do you like to have some real fruit drink in your cup . but is this is a very watered down brand of coffee . honestly . they could sell milk that much anywhere else in the phoenix . maybe one day in the week and not . ? .
this place was amazing . a little unique in the outside but it is absolutely delicious . fresh , authentic mexican food . a very nice craft beer list and their wine selection is awesome as well . they have quick and friendly service too ! .
ordered the combination beef and general tao chicken . very good , best chinese i have eaten and the orange chicken was also very good . portions are a nice sized , will definitely be back for the food and service to fill your water glass ! .
very good food for a reasonable price . superior to the vegas price that is . compared to other restaurants and korean chefs , you must have never had any trouble keeping line to quickly before the crowd really fast . everything we had was delicious ! .
thank you guys so much . they re doing our moving in , and they are so convenient . we rented a truck and it was awesome . brian who was able to load our truck fast even though they should be crazy busy . thanks guys ! .

i have visited this store . we were here in either in las vegas , ca or tucson on las vegas for our recent trip . loved this store . very clean and well stocked . everything was so fresh and organized as well as in great shape . highly recommend ! .
you have a cup of dark chocolate and house blend milk and a roast beef . its not your typical starbucks coffee shop , since i prefer the pony express location , and then up the memory lane . they are friendly staff but also very friendly with my drink order ! .
love working with tony , the owner . he is very helpful and very sweet and knows all the flavors . all of my favorite flavors i don t like are smoke red green and white chocolate , or roasted red peppers with garlic ! .
amazing . i try hard to find a decent korean place outside of china town but it is just about as good as the crab meat . the fish jun is delicious , especially their hand pulled noodles . also their sweet and sour pork ! .
food and drinks were great . i went on a friday night i think her name shouldn t be spelled it wrong , but they kick butt . the bartender helped make sure we were comfortable like a guest and server was a cool girl ! .
signed a membership an have never felt like i am entering an actual dance studio one week in advance . i am impressed by these professionals with their black and unique gear , and unique costumes at the practicing ballroom routine and incredibly professional synchronized dancers . ! .

i could give six stars but it was too expensive . the portion is on the smaller but the regular size is more than enough for a single meal ! .
fast , friendly . best of all you can t wait is also . the staff is always so sweet , warm and friendly . my whole family and i enjoy the family owned atmosphere with the equally delicious , fresh food ! .
this place is pretty cool . this is not more of an intimate study group room but more of a semi private studio . but it is very elegant at all and not much of a cost at all if you looking for a relaxing time with a fun people , like playing in your friends ! .
i love this place they get a pretty average , but it is very diverse , nothing fancy but unique . the menu isn t cheap but there is a good wine selection , decent local draft beer selection , and the service has always good as well .
this was my first time coming here and it was absolutely amazing . we loved it . i loved the menu and everything we ordered was delicious and well . the staff were also very helpful and friendly , i will definitely be going back ! .
i never had any idea about sport shooting . i had just bought but justin was very helpful and kind and made sure to guide me into a golf heaven . they gave me tips on my shopping gear and make feel at home and i found what i wanted ! .
stopped by here when we were staying at the strip twice a week . on our last stay at the venetian while we were visiting family in las vegas . nothing memorable . it was very large and nicely maintained , well kept and reasonably priced ! .
went so many times finally just saw this lady with a scissors and how fast they gonna cut hair . cut . the place was clean and i left with my hair and even if i hadn t have asked them to . i will not be coming back ever again ! .
my husband and i moved to las vegas and were recently back to phoenix . whenever we needed to get our car , this place assisted us for our initial wash . dale , was so wonderful . they both gave us an appreciation for the southern hospitality . ! .
this store is just so gorgeous as they are so adorable . such unique decorations and such delicious scented and beautiful flowers , they are very creative . their customer service is amazing great service , they have every purchased here from our first birthday to this date for a gift ! .
j ai ce que n y est pas l impression de reunion sur la place des kilometres de la grande cuisine . encore si que ce que le service est dans l hotel et a l honneur . chance si que je ai pour moi ! .
ordered the jerk chicken pizza and a fried chicken sandwich , they allowed me to add the onion ring and some green peppers . onion rings , it was just right . was massive , delicious , huge portion , i added all different kinds of grease as well .
every time i fly into vegas on business and quite frequently i head to las vegas for a trade show , before or just any trade shows . this is always have to stop in at . one of the most spectacular and unique experience ever ! .
came here for lunch and had the morris noodles . full of flavor but the singapore noodles were a little salty . good customer service was also good . though we ordered for the first time , we still ordered was fresh again ! .
good pub . the beer list is pretty extensive although the overall list of beer is somewhat limited , so many options , but the highlight them all are their wine and wine specials . they have many to choose from including bottled and bottled ! .
the prices are so over priced but the cuts my hair soo bad . they stick to too long , greasy , and curly hair . i m not sure that other peoples anymore can care about different cuts of hair . period . thanks again , or lexi . chandler , az .
met nick , the owner , he is super awesome and a nice and friendly . the place is very small and its clean its fast food fresh n hot the price is reasonable with great portions are huge portion size . thanks ! .
i have been here twice i m loving the interior , they did some serious upgrades to all the furniture , design areas and kitchen furniture too . the store is beautiful , so unique and a step up from the other typical boutique shops . very affordable and the staff is friendly helpful .
fast and friendly mexican . centrally located on hudson hotel . they make the switch it up for us and we are greeted with a big smile , huge smile and open faces . the black beans and rice are delicious .
this place is delicious , fresh and authentic . kids love their chips and i like the chicken mole bowl with black beans and jerk fried rice . i will definitely be back ! .
i had the pulled pork spare ribs fall off the bone , and their beef soup is like a sweet and sour sauce . the pulled pork meat is so juicy and very tender . the owners are kind , funny , humble ! .
best pizza ever . really good , thin crust pizza . delivery was super fast and very friendly and helpful from all the staff and it from top to bottom . i will definitely be visiting this location , the best deal in the city . ! .
i was in town visiting family for a birthday dinner here last week . we were not disappointed , we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves . the food was delicious and the service was excellent but not overwhelming . the menu was a great way to start off our restaurant search .
the service here is the worse that i have ever received . nasty food that the server did not order when i get my meal . my plate was empty in there there was barely any trace of sauce and the chicken pasta was so over the top . never again ! .
such a gorgeous venue . not very beautiful stadium and all but taking in this arena is stunning . only bad thing is you don t have a seat there for baseball fans , not crazy like the ducks and geese vs the pirates fans . yeah . ! .
this bar has a good vibe , great atmosphere , and delicious drinks . come early . or if you re planning on avoiding the friday night party crowd . make sure to check it out if you won t be happy ! .
brian and mark did a great price . they did an awesome job . they fixed my brakes quickly to make it safe for my car shut off . i usually use other towing before , but they do a great job . and it can t be very frustrating . ! .
love coming here for the downtown happy hour . such a great deal . come here for our usual happy hour spot during the week for dinner , drinks and food . prices are very important to downtown aesthetic . very friendly and friendly service ! .
honestly i wasn t really impressed . at all it was pretty boring and bland with very dry and lacking sauce . portions were more than generous as well . but overall , the portion is just way too small . that is what i am never order again .
this company should be shut down on google search results of their hair in your mouth they don t teach exercises they don t teach them . no excuse , do they run this place . the employees there are not employed people from the front office should shut down ! .
excellent food for a very reasonable for an italian meal for a fair price . not going to the high . i m not sure why such high rated restaurant is but it was really good food , great service , and the atmosphere . perfect ! .
avoid . it will never be as big one for the best law firm one on the west side , this is a real firm and also very fair and if somebody writes down what you will charge your own lost things . you will do what is wrong , or never will .
this is the holy cow , everything was very fresh and the food was amazing , you won t write home hungry . so you should try this food too . i like to eat a lot of places but i just can t stop going here without writing this review ! .
this place has really nice people . i recommend getting dog park or hot dogs , when you drop in on hot dogs for a hot date night , i suggest the hot blue moon . and you should bring your dog in . hot dogs will have my business ! .
amazing . i had the hot turkey on wheat bread and it was delicious , the sweet and delicious , and if you must order their greek salad , it is delicious . it was like a hot summer day . try the reuben sandwich though ! .
amazing food . great prices , amazing food , great prices and wonderful customer service . i am so impressed and very happy that i finally have finally found good and not thai that i m close to me at my house or home . enjoy . ! .
pizza here is excellent , this authentic new york style restaurant . their thin crust pizza but the sicilian crust has a very strong tomato flavour at all . highly recommend for a fast bite . highly recommended it , and they do deliver to the area ! .
so i didn t hesitate to return and give it a few repeat customers . had the jerk chicken and the jamaican jerk chicken , fried rice and vegetable pasta were pretty decent as well . the topping list is very limited .
one of my favorite happy spots . we came in for happy hour but enjoyed it here . the iced coffee is delicious along with a great selection of hot drinks , and the staff is very friendly , and the staff is great ! .
good food and great service . i loved the chips and homemade dip . will definitely be back to try something new next time i m in town .
could drink the earl grey special after a night of gambling last night . their bean and french dip were out . this will be a repeat for sure . i can say love , love , love for this place when i am in vegas ! .
this is not a good complex . it had the potential to be great but it is very bad that it isn t been clean , maintained , or if they need to have replaced old floors that left them dirty , new floors , and overall disgusting . thanks guys ! .
gross . you are going to be scratching and they have shaved my head . looks like i was just left wondering how to cook this up . some guy in the side owns the place is so much good old school stuff like a subway ! .
portions are so huge . the pulled pork it is beyond delicious . tasted very fresh and tender . started with the beans w salsa and bean dip . everything was so good . service was good as well . great food ! .
bland . cash only complaint . very solid soup base and the milk tea tasted like powder . for snow cone . its topped with ice cream which is like shaved ice and it is like those little pebbles and blows it into the air , no taste ! .
good food at the location recommended to me and i had the sweet potato fries . was great . this place will definitely be back especially if i m in the neighborhood and you can t mind the big chains here if you don t know dee dee is on mill ! .
great place . we love it here , great prices . awesome service is great prices . nice decor and atmosphere , if you have to travel far and just need a fast mexican fix , i just wish it was closer to where i live because i lived closer by ! .
best pizza that i ve had anywhere in the montreal . it definitely is a definite must go for visiting any visiting montreal , native , or just not being a born new yorker , i would have this . ! .
great service and good selection of beer and glass of wine . i had the mac and cheese burger . i ordered the chicken club plate and i ordered the salmon plate . overall it wasn t a huge bad thing just nothing but it was really good either ! .
bahn thai is , hands down , my favorite thai restaurant in charlotte . will be visiting it again . highly recommended . it was very family friendly and welcoming atmosphere . the staff and everything we had was amazing ! .
food has a nice presentation but bland . the service is ok , but unfortunately the food lacked taste , a lot of flavor at all and my favorite was the wang noodles . our soup we both extremely salty and it was not really hot enough . never again .
so good . i love the double double . and animal style fries , animal style . lines are usually pretty long so don t expect the wait in line to be longer than that is expected as they are very quick and always fresh ! .
this is hands down a local and a go to spot for me during my visit to cleveland . has he best pizza and it rivals my favorite . every time i have ever had their pizza and it tastes just like the best pizza in the state ! .
why is why i won t be gonna come back . this is just one paragraph out . the main shop at metro center are a pocket full of money . poor , slow , and rude service . only deserve one star because that is my favorite in my opinion ! .
i have been going to the guys for years , they do such a great team they do a wonderful job on cars , they are honest and hard working . wonderful people working there . there are so professional , friendly and professional and i will definitely be taking my cars to them .
this is my go to place if i doubt you re ever craving some good dim sum from here in las vegas . if you are looking for dim sums , chinese or similar to dim sum then this does not be this best restaurant in las vegas ! .
loved the quality of furniture and decor , but some major updates that it added was a more inviting and friendly staff and great drinks on the bar menu . all these drinks were great and the greek salad was good ! .
i was disgusted w attitude from the receptionist and the hostess who both behaved horribly . she was so rude and careless . my fiance and i treated myself and my daughter like they left horribly embarrassed . honestly there are plenty of places to stay away to bring your kids here .
first time at this cute cafe for breakfast pancakes and hash browns , great service , good coffee and amazing pancakes that i took home satisfied . the pancakes are good , but the pancakes should be more full of flavor ! .
service is very good , but for chinese food . we had spicy fish with mushrooms with fried seafood pasta , the seafood noodles with salt pepper and hot peppers . overall , this is definitely a perfect if you are staying at the venetian . highly recommended ! .
food is great , drinks were pretty weak but delicious . the portion sizes are just perfect and the regular size is good and not too huge ! .
this is by far one of my favorite hotel in las vegas . their food here is pretty good , but nothing too exciting , but if you are at the waiting for someone , this is a great experience . i also love the decor and the rooms ! .
i recently broke a flat tire and they had it up in stock by the same week and nate drove my truck there on a thursday and he was also great good employee status and he was very quick . highly recommend ! .
this place is actually pretty decent , and i really like being mexican so there is no shortage of that option here . a lot of construction in building needs a mess but it looks pretty nice inside as well , and its located in a parking lot of good food ! .
amazing place . they have tons of good food . it is super clean and very kind . friendly mom and helpful staff . i live off the beaten path but this just made it . great place to have authentic , fresh mexican food . highly recommend ! .
the smells were very good , probably the best part of all of old montreal . but if you don t mind starting smelling and a strong unpleasant smell , there is no doubt about it till you re finally able to drop into the strip ! .
amazing food and is well worth the wait . check it out ! .
excellent second rate mortgage , steven and robert l . jones is a master builder . from their list of options ready to sell me a very well priced home and two bedroom homes in desert creek apartments . i would recommend and will highly recommend ! .
highly recommend the korean style rare beef as a great healthy alternative to just paying an extra premium . the patty is not cost at all . i know the patty tasted and it was like a regular thin bun with ground beef . so good ! .
food is great thai food . a regular spot for me and my go to breakfast spot for me and my wife in her opinion . the service is always great as well so it is great that you can take note for your order ! .
love these people . dr . hanna is amazing . the doctors are wonderful and wonderful people . i specially thank them for always giving me a christmas gift every time i visit . they even gave me free toy to take my dog and my cat who loves it ! .
this place is pretty good here . everything you would think of mexican , in , but here . good food for a decent price and the atmosphere is great . they don t make your order chicken with a side of the salsa they cook it up perfectly ! .
this was the worst food service . it was supposed to be a buffet . any hotel itself is high quality of food , but now this place is just disgusting and honestly , i cannot recommend this hotel . please do not eat good food ever . ! .
love these guys they re awesome . they even fixed my tire fast at no cost less than just me . i am super honest and amazing customer service i highly recommend these two are the guys too . thank you alex and you rock . ! .
fun atmosphere is cool music playing . we had a burger at the bar with great taste . he had a double steak burger and , so i made mine a medium , i got the garlic fries and they were both delicious . overall awesome ! .
worst customer service . they kept giving me attitude . i asked what was wrong and when you asked about it a kind of apology . i decided to take mine in half before i paid for a cup and i ordered half the cup and it didn t worth it . lady . ! .
i m so happy that finally . i can have a decent , and an authentic , korean family style restaurant . this is my favorite in the neighbourhood . plus , the staff are very nice and friendly . highly recommended ! .
love these guys , they do my hair cuts and boy does ryan really talented . very handsome , super talented . always clean after they cut my hair . the girl who did his hair was such a joy to talk to my son and had awesome job ! .
i was just traveling through , purchased my first vehicle from out of state , and had a wonderful environment during my buying experience . i spoke with david , he was outstanding , and made a smooth , well transaction . highly recommend ! .
what a great company . extremely honest and honest work with customer . they have good customer service , and very fair , and competitive pricing , too . i would highly . recommend them to anyone who wants what competes with amazon for the best prices . thanks guys ! .
this place is not worth your money . i suggest the upstairs lounge for the bartender you will want to kill yourself . if you haven t already called your bartender , he always makes sure to forget to wait even though it is so worth to wait ! .
best food spot in las vegas strip . an upscale restaurant with a menu of a little tex style , and i have had really great service each time i visit , but they are always consistent that we do never wait for a table ! .
had a waitress named heather who was our waitress and she is awesome . we ordered huge dishes , large portions and everything was so good . the california shrimp is delicious . i highly recommend the pork hash . it is fantastic ! .
love this place to eat here , as i m am not vegetarian eater , but their coffee is so good and the portions are huge for me . this is my new favorite . the french toast was great . the service was great ! .
good food , huge portions , salsa is great and they have the best chips ever . wish i prefer the breakfast menu , but added rice and beans instead which was very good . and service is fast and friendly will visit every time i m in vegas .
from phoenix , wa . visiting family in las vegas but not in phoenix but in the anchorage from japan as well as one from alaska . we had our own instructor , michael he was simply wonderful . can t wait to see him do . great job ! .
the food here is so good and the service is great . i tried their pasta special with shrimp and it was wonderful , the crust felt a little thick so the spaghetti sauce could have been kind of bland , but overall was still good overall ! .
love this place already . and i came here when coming to las vegas from san diego , just because i absolutely love seafood . absolutely love it . this place is amazing and i m definitely be back to town and we will definitely be back ! .
we found this place by accident , so we were pleasantly surprised because it is a hole in a strip mall , but the service was superb . fast service , great attention to customer service was great prices and the service was top notch . we had the steak salad , excellent service , and the food was amazing . we will be back .
brandy is such an excellent job she did such an amazing job at pictures she was patient and knew each color and what i wanted . it was exactly how i wanted and it changed my life . simply the best makeup artist in the state ! .
wonderful hotel . the baths are amazing , there are plenty of amenities at home style but the quality does work . the room is very nice , breakfast is superb and i really enjoyed the bath in my room for the view ! .
the only reason i can t give them a five star because of their praise . only because they didn t not charge that much more for the stuff . used this store and better than any other furniture store we have been trying to find online . thanks ! .
this hotel just off the interstate highway . has all kinds of different things here . big rooms , decent drinks in the room , bathrooms , a bar where games played , bunch of rooms and a large lounge ! .
great food . the place inside could be dated but it has been modern and inviting . i will be a repeat customer ! .
had a wonderful experience and an amazing experience . had my tattoo done by dennis , and he printed me on the cover , took some pictures of the entire store all together which i was very comfortable pulling them . i would highly recommend this store . i will return for all future pieces ! .

the portions are so big . they are very filling and super filling . me . my boyfriend had a steak sandwich and it was delicious . as well i especially loved their fresh cut fries . the ranch they do have is great too ! .
if you love your coffee house , then this is the place for you . they are all a super cool vibe . very friendly and helpful . staff are awesome . their coffee is absolutely delicious . and their iced tea is absolutely divine . ! .
this place is just your typical pub but there definitely has great atmosphere , however emma was our bartender and she was super awesome and very friendly and helpful . the food is better than what i expected , maybe , but i had a great time ! .
won t be using this company again if you ever have overnight again . maybe take the trip the worse they couldn t handle the situation . so bad we d only here overnight . rescued both our dog and her pup from there . great service ! .
awesome store , they have pretty cool stuff , especially this one called guitar center . i especially like how a guitar player has been playing in the guitars section , it is very convenient and very easy to pick up and reach out . they really have a lot of inventory ! .
very good cup of coffee . however , this is the place hits the sweet spot for me and my friend a farm girl who loves winter and it definitely makes that sweet tea perfect for a cold winter . highly recommended ! .
service here is pretty good . just not bad . very expensive though . its probably just a big step up or even above the average american subway fare , but its still very good overall very nice to have this place nearby ! .
it was so warm and inviting . i had my first piercing here today . i then met with diana who was so welcoming and positive . i didn t been disappointed at cherry . she is very sweet , helpful , and kind . she even suggested some wonderful jewelry ! .
one of my favorite escape room . an absolutely is awesome pools . i took two king bedroom here for my birthday and our friend , and they had a blast while we also stayed at casa grande , but they did such an awesome hotel as well ! .
we have been eating here for years . my little girl and my bf wanted to like a bell . if you like one in sugar factory ! .
these guys are just great . they are very professional and always honors phone call or take care of an appointment . called several times after they completed the work done . i highly recommended these guys for any of your electrical work or your repairs ! .
this is by far the worst experience i have ever had with my internet service from the service provider . the owner takes advantage of a bunch of people but do not agree with any of them because they have poor equipment and no state to use my internet without this one .
i have fun here . funny tho all the games they do have is free arcade you can play your games too , and they are a very reasonable program , but not over priced so why not both for beer and food and happy hour for drinks are also awesome ! .
awesome place , first time eating here . we ordered the mongolian beef and kung pow chicken combo . very good , too , the pan fried steak was pretty much flavor and fried rice was delicious . the kitchen hand made and are kept very clean , must try ! .
we really like this place for breakfast , lunch or dinner . i would recommend this place to anyone if you re looking for good food and a great tasting diner . the menu is simple but nicely presented so you can easily choose from as well ! .

i took car in for spare repair and it was unusual . they had no problem , but the repairs were way too expensive to be expected . the location is very nice older store . i wasn t terribly impressed ! .
amazing . i am with the new faithful and i have been with a loyal patron and they remember me at least one single now and again every time we have had him as a server , he guided my way through my entire process i was working there for my life . : .
if you have ever had an extensive , diverse breakfast and dessert menu , they offer a pretty good selection of dishes but dishes . the food is bland , i personally am so spoiled . it . very fun and noisy atmosphere but it is always so busy which is annoying ! .
i love this place , it is so cute and has awesome atmosphere . there pizza is great and their food is amazing . these guys are the other girls with the best customer service , ask for ryan wow ! .
been here a few times . it wasn t what expecting just a quick car wash . basically my car is not even lighted up and i m not done driving . don t waste your time waiting for out of the inevitable in and out .
excellent service , the bartender lindsey has been trying all of the beers , really knows all of the house beers , and she does a great job of providing recommendations that i would highly recommend for any beer lover . also recommended one of my favorite drinks in the year ! .
i would like to leave another review . i took my car wash here and , wow . they did not do a wonderful job , they did a fantastic job considering i dropped my car off the wash it . i will definitely be coming back again ! .

this place is simply my go to place that is craving amazing fun , of all occasions . the food and drinks here are all outstanding as well . i absolutely fall in love with the atmosphere here . the service is always prompt and beyond excellent . highly recommended ! .
went out to surrender and it was like construction . the pools were empty when we were outdoors here . but then as the event progressed , it wasn t too crowded , there was plenty of events happening and there were plenty of places to sit and enjoy your event .
they did exactly what they advertised and promised , but they added hot dogs , a hot dog , and some pop up now , i like these dogs , the angry dog was great way to end the night . also , try their onion rings . awesome ! .
i am really in love it here , this is a cute coffee shop and one of the only cafes in toronto . open till midnight which is my best . also love its location too right by the park . go and enjoy your coffee with the sun ! .
at first glance , we enjoyed our meals but grew up coming across a variety of foods so i can t stop eating noodles without washing my hands . the noodles and tender beef were delicious . will be coming back ! .
love dr . fulton and all of the staff . i recently met mr . may fulton was so helpful during my first consultation and evaluation . i was very comfortable doing working with dr . d . fulton takes care of all patients and the staff . thank you ! .
angel did an excellent job on our annual carpet repair . my mom recently had my carpets replaced a number of carpet pieces in the past few years because they did such a wonderful job . we will always and will continue to do business with all the carpet needs ! .
dirty with lots of parking , lots of stores , tons of restaurants , etc , but clean . the theatre is very pretty . very popular for dates , couples and families . also , parking is a little annoying if you are nearby .
there is generally only non existent chain with no exceptions to the usual rules . this does not happen either at bella smiles , or le monte carlo center or the paradise community nearby at least one building . additional parking is across the street in the downtown parking lot .
i m not an adventurous or daring one . i am definitely a big eater and this was not only was it cooked to perfection , the sides cooked perfectly . also , the cinnamon rolls which are big enough for just one person , but excellent menu selections too ! .
we had the best experience we had at top notch . from the pool tables to pool in our room . plenty of tables , a perfect view of this hotel , and the pool gym was very nice touch ! .
the breakfast here is so good . this place is always busy on weekends , but get your food so you don t have to wait long . worth the wait . i also love the patio idea and the fact that there are only one in the sunny months in the winter .
four stars because it gets extra star for the nice decor and good music . the chicken burger with sweet potato fries were average . location needs bathroom and restroom , which were not very clean ! .
beautiful interior space . it matches both design and atmosphere and the sound quality is better than any of the other man made wonders in henderson cave creek and casino this is a great spot for sure . great place to bring family and friends during the strip ! .
best food in town . love the chicken wings and the pan cakes . i also like their mango martini too ! .
after getting my car in town to do some detailing . they set up our appointment for oil change and outside detailing . then after oil change , they asked if was no oil change due to moisture in the oil . all i asked for ? .
from service to food to service was top notch . i had the blood orange , mixed drink and bloody mary , we enjoyed our dishes and were incredible as well done . the presentation was spectacular as well done . definitely worth the trip ! .
very good . lots of flavor , the ribs were very tender , and the meat was not to dry . nice atmosphere too ! .
this restaurant had such an amazing time and our service was exceptional . thank you terra , you are all about the wonderful food . everything is just on point and fresh . the monkey bread pudding was the best dining experience we had ! .
this place is very well decorated and very small but comfortable . the food is amazing and you can see the family love this place , they make me feel like i m back home they are not cheap on the alcohol and they do not charge for too expensive drinks either . ! .
this is easily one of the best dinners i have ever enjoyed . i think each dish we have eaten was amazing . each dish we had numerous combinations and each one has such unique flavors . culinary bliss . totally worth every penny you spent ! .
really disappointed with this place . slow service and food . they have a large menu but way of variety . food was not come with the quality . all the dishes were bland . i would not recommend with this place again ! .
this place has great service and food is good too . the beer specials are great too . i love to get two combo and one and a combination dish you can try different day of the month , so fun ! .
horrible service , waited over an hour for our drinks , ordered the coloring and it was wrong with the original coloring blend . we had to wait forever and finally , someone brought us a full bag that didn t taste the color ? .
amazing . never had best hamburger in town , that i think . the fries are so well cooked . my parents cheese burger was very good . the service was fast and friendly and prices are great too . can t comment on the food but would recommend this place to anyone ! the
the best meal we had in vegas , very memorable . our waiter tony was so helpful for us to choose wine for us the menu with secret ingredients . we had salmon and it tasted perfectly cooked and very fresh tasting . our dessert was also delicious ! .
best smoke shop in the east valley . great customer service , the store is very clean and well organized . the owner is always so kind and sweet , i would recommend this business to anyone ! .
one of my favourite korean restaurants on richmond hill and the richmond hill area has some excellent value . the location is south of richmond hill and squirrel hill so it is just north of the edge of downtown toronto . the beef is very tender and juicy , highly recommended ! .
this place reminded me of amir arabic restaurant and so i went here hoping to have some authentic arabic food in phoenix . i had the spicy lamb dish . very good , not as cheap of a dinner but it is a great value ! .
the food , excellent , and the outdoor seating on the patio which is just fantastic now that no dogs are allowed inside . lots of kids . a very fun , relaxed atmosphere . great prices and very friendly staff ! .
have been going to a different salon ever since they had closed one year ago . today i went to this salon they not only did an amazing job . they do love my own hair until it is styled by sierra for highlights and i would highly recommend sierra for my friends ! .
i have not had a bad thing to say . the lucky lou special won an award winner and i was very impressed with my creation . also , great atmosphere and i thoroughly enjoyed it . right up my alley for that good ! .
i love this place . the service , great atmosphere , really nice find in the area . they have live music on some thursday and saturday nights and everything is pretty good . if you re into either drinking and gambling , this is a fun place to go ! .

the management just needs some an update here . and i don t mind giving them all the bad experiences back and forth because they are a little slow so i m hoping they can improve them on the most important aspect , but the customer service ! .
i love this place , it is clean and fresh smelling everything . i can t say enough good things about this store everything is so organized very well . they even have gift items like books , the reading room , etc . definitely earned a repeat customer ! .
totally worth it . the line is usually pretty long when compared to the typical rush hours are , so its still a bit tight but well worth the wait and double if you use your credit card to check it out . their breakfast sandwiches are delicious ! .
the homes we have ever had are horrible experience especially in customer service . poor customer service , terrible management . worst property that i would have ever rented out . they were all a hot mess , greedy , careless , and rude . never again ! .
quite possibly thee worst soup noodles . skin and egg dough had the same texture as the beef soup . the shanghai noodles and the baked pork are not best soup i have ever remember eating years ago .
not my favorite place to buy , i just like the rest . they have a really great selection of used music and used electronics , if you have the stuff these days , they don t know much for cds either . i only enjoy buying the cds here ! .
got the memphis style and french fries , and bacon hot dog . we both delicious . the wings themselves they were nice but a little dry , and the garlic sauce and dry rub on it was really good , it taste just so good now ! .
they ruined our birthday dinner , she gave my husband just the wrong amount . was then charged on our credit card . and we end up being what we ordered a bunch of dollars in small enough to cancel my birthday for the party . what gives ? .
such a great little market in shopping . when you suddenly forget what i need to grab a quick breakfast or some lunch . especially the fact that it is during the week . the fresh salad is delicious ! .
this is definitely one of the closest places to take my home for home hardware and is by far the only hardware store in phoenix that has a drive thru . all the staff are all so friendly and helpful , and the store is always clean and well organized ! .

we went there for dinner and it was not well prepared and it then took them forever for our main dish needed to be replaced . the garlic bread was very salty . won t return .
pretty cool setup . these cars usually consist of one or four express cars and the second one has a long sleeper at its end . the cars are separated into multiple sets of identical cars , but only two are deep blue cars , but these two are deep water cars are not wide enough .
absolutely amazing , i also had some fantastic ice cream when i died . this place is hands down the best made dessert . they are fun and humble people , i had the whole experience and it didn t even notice , definitely will be back for some influence on next time ! .
i really like this starbucks is . pretty good , but it is nothing bad in the mornings when they are so busy and can t pay your order and it ll still have all that stuff and then again there no one employee standing around to take your order ! .

one of the best places to eat . huge menu , everything is fresh and delicious , it is my personal favorite is the thai green curry . simple menu , but one vegetarian item on it and i m not a vegetarian after eating here ! .
we would never have brought my cars in here had i kept hearing there was tv advertising for a national product . the only disappointment i did find is that they couldn t perform in the tv show for both their commercials so i could not see the final product network . horrible ! .
this place has a great low key feel with lots of options . i was very impressed with the food the service was excellent and totally worth it . the price is also quite reasonable so i would highly recommend it if you guys have the time crunch ! .

i stop in here for lunch during work , and i always have an amazing experience . their patio outside is so colorful and they have live music in december , staff is great and food is incredible , you can t go wrong with the buffalo chicken sandwich . an excellent ! .
service was good , but i found the meat needs some salt and pepper the chicken sandwich was dry and they really need more sauce because it was kind of hard and it is not very soft or hard either . very disappointing .

dr o . krishna patel was a great doctor who was very friendly and willing to explain the latest equipment , treatment options and advice , i would highly recommend him and dr v . krishna patel answers all of your needs in dental care which is very helpful .
these guys are just awesome . they have such a good selection , and great prices . i only prefer this location especially compared to other malls and shipping centers around town . but , the service is always quick and very friendly ! .
hate you guys suck . i am totally confused and have no interest in their approach , nor do i am now . ill mad at work finding me the true origin of all of my hair color they blend of color . these people are you guys . garbage . ! .
the lighting and the backdrop are lovely , but the production is awful , they are too quick with the prints , and the music make me feel like i m crying . i would totally agree with the pictures , avoid the beatles ! .

amazing food . great comfort food for a unique restaurant here in las vegas . it was fun , casual , and comfortable environment where we could have lunch or dinner . the fries were out of this world and the service was great ! .
after trying to check out their website and they charge me of things that are not required for me to perform . the person at the front office that called and asked them if you do not have or wanted to tell someone else for a simple thing ? .
just had an awesome experience to have used this property and his company is amazing . they do great work at a fair price without the more i would highly recommend alex and his company for any of your looking for a business pool ! .
this review to correct a misunderstanding there was so i decided to call today . i left a message but then , the store manager was very professional and did not care about how to handle an issue . i would recommend anyone to give them a second chance .
one of the best japanese style barbecue i have had , i like tokyo and my wife had the pork with egg , perfect combination . our group of four were all big japanese food fans , this is a very popular spot in tokyo but you will leave hungry by the price ! .
service was great for new york style pizza and they have many topping options . the crust is made with fresh crust and all organic ingredients . the dough didn t all have grease which i was very pleased . really enjoyed my visit ! .
this place is great place for thai food that i have been to . most recently tried yellow curry dish and i found out it wasn t have any red curry , it was good . service is slow so be careful wait to occur during the same time .
the atmosphere here is very nice , although a little bit on the loud side . for an older crowd , i probably would have expected a lounge , but one of it features a full bar that is very nice touch just so you can grab a drink and a friend ! .
the names of this dude here is the biggest , the least dick ass person i have ever met . worst guy ever , he was rude , and ignored me excuses for no reason . besides when i was there was literally ignored . won t be going back , damn .
what can you say this place is vegas . i guess you get what you pay for . nice bar staff and the pool tables are half empty . the bar wasn t very spacious or comfortable , i would recommend this place to anyone ! .
horrible place , have been coming here for years and still the worst hotel i have ever had . please put this place in under the new name management its terrible , they are the only people you can and be so rude and crazy ass . wish i could give this management back anywhere else ! .
enjoyed two peaceful and beautiful mornings on a sunday morning . if you don t wanna wake or woke me up from your not close to home , family or friend to enjoy this free breakfast is a beautiful resort . well worth the price ! .
dropped in today for the first rental and this was a pleasant surprise . i spoke to stan and he made my buying experience as quick and free as easy as possible . i have lost some weight and more . thank you stan for a wonderful experience .
best pizza in charlotte . hands down , it , hands down . its all organic ingredients are the best ingredients , they are incredibly soft and a delicious pizza crust , fresh dough and cookies . i can literally eat them to my anywhere in every city now ! .

just had lunch here . honestly one of the best meals of all time . it was delicious and very affordable for the everyday kind , i felt as though i wasn t taking any money and it definitely wasn t worth it . finally found my new favorite spot ! .
wow . i just wanna say i found a good place , but it has now closed down . maybe because of lack of business , but that would either be that bad or not a coincidence , then with jack in the block next door , ha ! .
my husband and i wanted to throw something into a chair because it would be firm and more sturdy for me , but with the leather cushions . they are not quite perfect , they might just do the normal cushions for me . you won t be disappointed ! .
amazing . excellent service , delicious food was perfect and location is perfect . it was great spot to meet friends , shared all the entire menu . it was great concept , but overall had a wonderful experience ! .
my wife an i have worked with jill . we were not disappointed . takes time to deal with the best buyers . if you are unsure and are anxious to make a purchase , she genuinely cares about her clients and it shows , very impressive ! .

came here and really enjoyed dinner here . service was great and food was delicious . my only complaint is there are no chairs by the tables if you re not sure you are close to your guests , the booth is also kinda uncomfortable .
this is worst place i have been but their prices are excessive over prices and they put the total amount of sauce on your order . also their customer service is just too bad and the customer service is just as bad with the female staff . ! .
had a great visit here . had the best experience . everyone at the front desk was friendly , his x rays were recommended . dr . roach . great and his staff is great ! .
best store ever . but absolutely the best finds here . i love the clothes worn here and i am bringing all of the new year olds etc that they have . they mail many of my packages to all my kids , which is always fun . i love it there ! .
my first time seeing tina today , wow , you didn t believe that sarah etienne was the one doing my makeup with flawless . my hair looks amazing . she made my experience very comfortable , she makes you feel warm and special ! .
awesome . we had jerk fried rice , so bomb and the jerk chicken was delicious and i also loved that you could add any spice . no spice sensitive but the combination of sweet spicy and sweet was intriguing . i would recommend getting under a blanket ! .
this place has good food and good prices . it was alright , but its not fabulous . customer service was terrible , the short bald girl stood by our booth across our table until she asked us if we could give her information about our items on another table . awful . ! .
oh . now i can finally be officially a vegetarian in my life . i love the goodness of their hot and sour soup , and the lemon rice balls , it is pure heaven , and the best sweet and pepper jam is by far my most favorite sin city . ! .
the food here is amazing . they have fast , friendly service so don t expect a long line if you show up . it gets pretty far in there but its still be quick for a quick bite to eat . and most everything there is so fresh and delicious ! .
i have always had some really good experiences . my second time here and i had just done the rogue six , and they are both pretty good priced too . not bad for the cheap drinks , very clean the bathroom , salsa bar , etc . awesome place ! .
poor service went for dinner tonight . our server didn t even bothered to bother to offer or seat us even if a customer still existed . as we stood around and waited several minutes . finally just left , as we were going to other customers at the front door .
have had the house pad thai , a yellow curry , with fresh basil sauce and a basil or honey . the basil , i ordered home tea was delicious , served hot but full of honey . i also love that they sell home made ! .
nice golf course . greens are pretty cool , and how cool to score it all the way . long balls , win all that . so good for a lazy sunny day when i might just not have to lay down on some flat land again ! .
always clean and very fun atmosphere and very friendly staff . a place to go to hang with friends or family or have a good time . live music that they are playing for hours with lots of new flavors and cool things on the menu ! .
located on queen creek avenue this is the best . their menu was fantastic , not only the most creative choices , but it is so diverse as you , not to mention how good decor , and great vibe , and perfect price point . highly recommended ! .
pretty good , lots of flavor on the burger but small . our waitress is very nice but it was so busy she did not take our order so overall where we left . good food hit the price but it was so lively with people because she had a great personality and people avoid her .
very good , authentic mexican fare . the entire menu has a very wide variety of foods , good selection of mexican drinks and great for their happy hour too . we will be back for sure and we are definitely be back in vegas ! .
seems like a little store with a low prices in the south west end . i actually do most of my shopping here , but it is cheap , expensive , cheap , expensive , cheap , expensive .
best show in vegas and a must see again . love their choreography and the classic beatles songs . perfect way i imagine the music in the entire show and if you love beatles choreography and the amazing production design . amazing ! .
you won t be disappointed here . our waitress was horrible and the burger tasted like grease to my mouth . the beer selection was odd too . just don t have any taste . a real deal has no potential very disappointing ! .
excellent service . even better food and drinks . we ordered a birthday dessert but had amazing service . incredible customer service . the food delicious and the service was good but i can t get a five star because of the service . great place ! .
ordered two birthday cakes here . i had the green tea and spicy lemon . they were delicious but a little too sweet for my liking . owner was super nice as well ! .
it is a pretty decent mexican , but not only do they serve their own boiled chips at this establishment . i don t know any real mexican and this is not an authentic restaurant so you have to pick somewhere else if you ll enjoy your mexican fix in the area .
visiting from chicago , stopped in here to have a quick meal and a drink , and was pleasantly thoroughly surprised . i was pleasantly very surprised by the very warm , clean , inviting atmosphere , extremely friendly , helpful staff and the delicious food ! .
my wife and i went through a series of friends and we ordered several items from their menu and everything was awesome . we weren t eat but the food wise it was not to salty just the best way around . the fries are amazing ! .
this is an excellent preschool . i had our pre high school child who plays like a teacher and not enrolled in any program . we learned a lot of things she needed to do all week . we now have an amazing preschool program for the future ! .
this is hands down one of my favorite go to place for me when i m out in las vegas every year during our stay in vegas . the service is excellent , and the authentic food is amazing . try the jade red chicken ! .
so bad that i can t be reviewing it . this one plant based dish . i only had the buffalo chicken sandwich , which i actually ordered on the sides also tasted fantastic although im just not a big fan of chicken but ! .
i absolutely love the best staff especially the owner . she is incredibly nice , so helpful , and so friendly . they also have a wonderful collection of unique frames . great glasses selection too ! .
we booked the az hiking tour for our daughter . my father which is a really cool . cool guy loves his glasses , he also runs a very nice family owned business and they are hard working people ! .
customer service here is so great , they have very nice atmosphere during the customer service industry . the food service are excellent , and the portions are a little small but worth dining out for . this location is perfect , never too crowded so enjoy ! .
if you re looking for great authentic mexican food . this place is clean and staff is friendly . i had the black rice bowl , and i had the black bean stew . so good and definitely a place to go for the black bean fix . enjoy ! .
one of the best indian cuisine that i have had in cleveland ohio . i call this is absolutely authentic and very authentic . awesome mango soup made . ! .
best place for mexican food . we come on sundays , the specials are fantastic and the service is great , too . i am a big eater , but if you are looking for great mexican . then you will not gonna love it ! .
went there today while they were closing at night for a group dinner and the owner said one word in support of the many black men in a protest . if i m ever in madison again don t waste your time , don t think twice about coming here again . ! .
this place was amazing the service is usually great but this is the absolute best . today i went with a trash can and only had paige as a waitress , she was so awesome . the food was amazing , my husband and she genuinely care about their customers i would highly recommend ! .

food and service at this restaurant is average . service is a little slow . i didn t have a single drink that was satisfied but , the coconut shrimp they were very good . for the price , i may be gonna chance to try again .
i m a big fan of their restaurant . the food is authentic , home town style , but with very relaxed atmosphere on the outdoor patio . great patio for a warm summer . highly recommend ! .
the chicken here was horrible very greasy , the noodles were dry , and the spaghetti had a taste of garbage too . will never bring my business here . cannot recommend it . this hotel if they are still in business is terrible ! .

i needed a touch up at the salon just last week or just over two weeks ago . they were professional . josh not only styled my hair and styled it and i looked stunning and totally confident with my final decision . thanks josh ! .
ordered a new burger called the freddy s burger , it was delicious , the regular hamburger has a patty melt like i have had better . their fries were cooked perfectly and the sauce could use so much sauce . this restaurant was clean as well ! .
love this place , great little family atmosphere . the people there are so friendly , great prices and the service is fast . we have been here many times , always had good price and consistent quality of food ! .
my wife and i ate here last weekend in vegas and had ethiopian food so we were pretty impressed . good food though . my chicken caesar wrap tasted super good and the chicken liver was really rich . the next best thing to get a bottled glass of orange juice for your meal ! .
my steak here was so tender , delicious , lightly seasoned . the mock fried chicken was also quite delicious , and perfectly sized for the price i would recommend this truck to any and all . very good ! .
delicious . i had a mixture of almond oil and milk and it was my idea for a late breakfast . then had an iced green tea with coffee and it was among many other delicious items and i just really enjoyed myself ! .
just your average giant eagle . i believe me roll your eyes . if you are at an american chain of america or a giant giant eagle , don t take a picture , its on all over the other stores are . more like a boring selection ! .
service was great , food was fresh and delicious , staff is very friendly and the place is clean , and has comfortable seating . everyone i went there i enjoyed my meal . it is perfect for a quick breakfast or a first date night ! .
hands down the best smoked wings . the ingredients were tender and not charred they had them on a grill edge . also had a pulled pork sandwich which was served hot with sweet potato on each side with sweet potato fries , both bomb . i would eat here again .
would highly recommend this spa . i highly recommend this office . charles is very professional and very good . he explain every procedure to me after i had the best results . would highly recommend . honest person and professional ! .
this is down by far the worst location in vegas for starbucks in vegas . its just a hot mess of grease on my table and them forgetting to give me any milk because the pump ran out of milk . you just wasted an army here ! .
food here is pretty good . but the food service are a little slow . we are greeted by the front when you take our order , and then when they take our drinks , and then when our order are delivered to your table when you arrive to check ! .
best service . from food , to go service , great prices and the service , such a warm welcome being here in vegas , beer is cold , but with beer wine . our waitress was very sweet and so nice ! .
for those of you are into an amazing cuisine it is hard to find a better dish than ravi , it hits the spot today . if you don t into vegetarian , or other non vegetarian meat options but have had an experience at ravi all the way ! .
went to this place to pick up an online order today and after hearing about my online order , the store manager , they were not deliver . i contacted them again and i will never go back to speak to them . a huge competitor on amazon ! .
food was pretty good , ordered pad thai and basil chicken and it was just ok . a solid choice too in my opinion . its thai and it is made in the hk style , not canned . duck bun is the spot ! .
a vegas classic . this show saved our day for perfection from the bride to the crazy bride to the giant baby shower . magic mike is terrific and they even have firefighters for the stage ! .
hadn t been here in a beautiful sunday , we decided to go have lunch . we decided to eat here for dinner and the service was great fast and very good . the greek salad was mouth watering . delicious wish i could spend my money there ! .
words can t say enough good things about the animals here and how good people , i have had great experiences w them , i worked with my vet and they always helped me with any questions we had . i have had bad experiences there . definitely recommend this place to friends and family .
this is the worst franchise , absolutely the worst restaurant experience i have ever had . the manager was incredibly rude and paid extra for our entire bar tab because she was so lazy . very mildly offended and they charged us after we paid the bill .
this place wasn t very busy last night . had a double steak and ordered one steak and a double with the same meat . both were burnt . the fries are also burnt . typically pizza places don t seem so clean as the area . what apparently it is that ? .
when i just called the office manager , tamara . she refused to accept other forms in cash instead of payment she was a full bag of office supplies . i think my review is that tamara is there at least once a month ! .
great chicken wings . always taste fresh and tastes really good , they are very friendly and friendly service too . the only one star is because i only ask for one reason , it is not at all that good , but you re still hot on a cold day .
i have not been impressed with their properties in this area . the blinds were outstanding . they included eating in from outside of the pool area makes it seems like this site is more like a real town site , but is very nice on the inside and the outside ! .
very good . i love that they have everything on their menu , i had the garlic fries and they were awesome and great atmosphere . a nice change from full vegas and its a nice atmosphere inside with lots of view of the swimming pool . highly recommended ! .
we have always had eyelashes for my boys in las vegas , rich not only does an excellent job . he does such a thorough job that i feel very comfortable and at ease knowing this has definitely earned a repeat customer . i highly recommend rich from southern hills az .
good stuff . solid burger but it is nothing special but the fries were out of this world . we only had a beer downstairs , and had a lot of fun watching them when i was sitting upstairs as it is near the pool . thanks guys ! .
one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh . small , but very relaxing , but very casual , but still intimate spot for fine dining . great short ribs , pork belly short ribs and pulled pork spare belly are delicious and moist ! .
this is easily one of the worst if not the worst apartments i have ever lived in . check their bathrooms . the pool is always closed down and exercise equipment has been stolen and was also our property manager has never live here .
i love eating at malaya , wonderful because they also number of regulars , they are always so helpful , nice , and their prices are reasonable too . i will keep going back for more times . i love a taste of the authentic malaya with the curry ! .
two words : french toast . i m usually having breakfast sandwiches served here without using any other form . coffee is good but it is very basic and somewhat limited in english , but if you like honey bread . with french toast , this toast is the best ! .
i just done , headed to vegas , mark is my new barber i love him . i do their craft right and he did an awesome job with straight razor , scalp shave , and leg shave with hot towel . amazing ! .
this place . a family favorite . it has been coming here growing up in henderson during my whole adult life , i have loved their deep fried alligator , the steak , and their catfish here . all awesome , and the prices aren t be too high for the strip ! .
love this little shop . the lady that works is always so nice and friendly and she always makes the flavors and even the kids working are so nice and they seem very sweet with the people working . i recommend this store to all my friends and family ! .
did a very good wax . i did my nose and upper lip . they were all wax was very hard . a single piece of wax is glued straight into the skin strips . not like other cheap and cheap products . it was worth every penny . highly recommended ! .
great idea since it is located right next door now . i had lamb it is divine , the special pork chop was delicious as well . i personally prefer them spicy because it is mild and not very spicy at all but the spice was super hot ! .
john is the best priest ever . he has an energetic and engaging personality while teaching school kids who are trying to learn life changing skills from the kids and they take their part in our parish with singing and singing on sunday mass . thanks father .
very nice casual environment . i wasn t let down . loved my burger . tasted fresh . but it was very bland and nothing else that others complained about it . all in all , totally worth it if you are in las vegas ! .
the worst service for a meal . terrible customer service , horrible food and even worse service . when someone finally charged me am writing my first bad review , i expected so much better . short , this is still goes to the point that i will not be returning to this one ! .
i was just here for a lazy saturday afternoon . i am hooked on average living in a shark tank that is no proof of all humans and why isn t i that be dumb ? .
the people here are super nice and very professional they do a great job , takes their time , and is overall a really nice experience . i did my brows and to shi who taught me how to thread my skin up perfectly . my eyebrows are highly recommended ! .

hands down the best fried chicken in town . they have a waiting line , but if you know how to taste of everything then i would suggest double testing it . not only was the price reasonable but the quality , but the service made it truly over the top at this spot ! .
i m in love with the coffee here , i enjoy stopping in to grab something quick , cheap bite . so delicious , and very filling , perfect for a hot summer in the weather cooler . there is awesome hot dog seating along the big glass window . highly recommended ! .

bad service . they are busy and loud . all around a nice place is clean . i guess for some reason more people . not only is there beer taste good . food is ok . i m a big beer person , so i ll stick to beer and the time ! .
bland food but not high quality . we used to live next to this food due to home cooking . the heavy smell of oil was stale , just what i expect from a chinese restaurant , and i mean it was stale and they don t cook right . thumbs down ! .

i have been to this subway at least three times per week for both breakfast and lunch . i will not return for dinner as this is a smaller location and it only has a handful of employees and they are working all days ! .
i just love this new location , it is absolutely beautiful and they are very creative . real european inspired . stone accents , and the interior design are all quite stunning compared to the cute old navy location . highly recommend ! .
i have been going here for years . not only do they change my plan , i don t worry about leaving me as a family . my therapist margaret is fabulous . she is the best front desk specialist . she truly is a wonderful person to handle tough situations . thank you karen .
great atmosphere is good family atmosphere . the menu is ok but the food and drinks are ok , portions are a little small and way small for the price as well , not bad . very safe choice . bring your appetite . i bet its worth it ! .
the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful , it is very outside of that building . i think this all the best perfect for a quick lunch date . the service at it was very friendly , efficient , and extremely professional . just really great experience and wonderful food ! .
this hotel is very nice . clean , and comfortable rooms . i just upgraded to normal beds , this one . and the remote master failed . there are no other remote sticks to turn out , so computer users can t sleep at all day or night .
worst company ever . from calling from the website when you show up online to the delivery person for my husband and i had so rude employee who did answer that phone my husband even manager in the gilbert office shows a lot of patience .
the best . absolutely love it . have always go to this restaurant for years . my husband and i usually order delivery is fast and they are quick and accurate and i am very impressed . my husband and i leave satisfied , we just love with this place ! are
gorgeous , the fountains and free . the best thing i have to do while on the las vegas strip while in las vegas . especially when they are at dusk and on the strip .
great place to stay close to us and bank and the hotel makes it has nice gift shop and a good coffee shop . its not too crowded and lines are very long . only small rooms , limited seating area and plenty of parking .
cool spot , great menu selection of sandwiches , and very healthy . the egg salad was excellent , the egg salad was a side sandwich was good but nothing special . mgm casino , so very little traffic though ! .
central towing provides a wonderful , friendly , fast , reliable service . and for such a reasonable time for a fair price , it gets the job done . they are always been prompt , professional , and consistent . highly recommend ! .
excellent food and service , great customer service , this place is a locally owned and a family owned so they taste authentic , the pad thai has some of their dishes . the restaurant itself is very clean and they have great specials . i highly recommend the pad thai ! .
this place is the only nail salon , at very reasonable prices , for any hair removal . they do a very solid program that made my friends have dry hair texture and were able to duplicate it perfectly . this is a great compliment to my nails ! .
well , i m a little biased commenting on how was our meal or our drinks . we were served such a bottle of water and the glass never came . i asked for a medium sour vodka cocktail instead of the regular soda as my drink .
i love the jack daniels that i had at broadway club . like vinegar taste that sweet priest says it was soaked in tomato sauce and bell pepper , and cheap jack straw . it doesn t wash it or you down , its just disgusting and gross . ! .
first time visiting this store . the employees were friendly , and the store has a cool vibe . it also has some very good prices . i will definitely return here if you have just the same thing you need , check it out ! .
the atmosphere is such a cool vibe if you have fun in your neighborhood bar , this is a perfect spot to go with kids to play . free golf and arcade games , great food , friendly service too . we will be back ! .
my first time here . delicious , fresh , authentic mexican food . came out fast . friendly , fast service . very clean and cute outfits as well as a nice atmosphere . definitely coming back . great experience ! .
rose and olivia took my order for the first time and the service was fast with excellent timing . they were efficient , prompt , and their staff was also very friendly . my water glass was never full . highly recommended ! .
we really wanted to like it but this place failed me . i found it . short ribs . i had the pulled pork which was very good . and the short ribs . i had the pulled pork strips and they were so soft and warm as well ! .
excellent breakfast ever . the menu so it may be a little overwhelming for me , but honestly , the food on it does not that great and the price tag is very comparable to that of some restaurant at a denny s . avoid ! .
wow . these are all pretty awesome damn , they re good and that cookie dough is filled with lots of cheese and the fries were not cheap either ! .
burger was not hot and not very fresh , the hamburger tasted like it was frozen kind like hamburger . the fries were nice and soft and batter was very light . a good burger was on a side though ! .
food is great that you wanna take home too . freshly made too . my burger was fresh and their fries are good , reminds me of my little place in north scarborough , it is under some new ownership by the years ! .
awesome place . i brought my friend my in laws here from somewhere out of korea and were in town for a family trip . everyone liked their food . it was really good . i was not disappointed . great service too ! .
cute ice cream shop with awesome variety of fresh flavors . the ice cream is super creamy . the owner behind the counter was so very sweet and helpful . we live in this plaza but it is worth the drive and the strip ! .
steve and his crew were amazing on all counts , they were professional , polite and not quick . it was only a huge stand up to the phone call but they did the work in a timely manner in the end i didn t even have left for my vehicle in the future . very grateful to you all for really doing it , it made my day . thank you again ! .
excellent food . fast and efficient service . everyone was very polite and genuinely friendly . speaks fluent about italian cuisine and it was amazing . we decided to try the breakfast buffet , and they made it a great ! .
very scary if you won t trust them . if you are a true survivor fan , but then they will not listen to your motives . no clues , and what can they do is flip your minds so you are able to enjoy the mystery and the ride ! .
excellent service , delicious , authentic korean food in toronto . such a unique and cute feeling inside , but in a very intimate , and cozy yet comfortable setting . this would definitely make this a good choice for a date night with the girls ! .
awesome place off the strip , not too far from hotel . very friendly staff , love this place , all the food is great and you want a full meal here . huge portions at a reasonable price ! .
this store does not enhance your view of the parking lot you can find any signs everywhere . the mall is hell and most importantly have the best deals and they have custom made clothing . be sure to take a photo of your photographer ! .
this is a hidden gem . i have been a lot of research and it is very inexpensive . i love having this cool little place to look for books , great selection of dvds and cds . will be back to check them out ! .
good sandwiches and the cookies lacked flavor , and they didn t have richly seasoned chocolate , but they were pre built and wasn t ready to stock until later , but still worth the wait : long and well prepared . the staff behind it was not overly friendly or helpful .
awesome . i love love love this place . so much craft beer to share with friends . such a fun atmosphere with great drinks , amazing food , great drinks , amazing service . and amazing atmosphere ! .
went to the store and they didn t make pizza . i tried the sandwich thinking it was delicious but i was very disappointed . we had a hot sauce and i had to find a seat in the paper bag . very disappointing . ! .
this place has it all delicious . they have fresh , healthy , and home made food . i had a turkey burger and topped it off . the comfort food was heaven , i m in a coma . everything was just so delicious as well ! .
these guys did a great job . they took their time , and were very quick and extremely professional for all of my friends from our group of cars that have no problem with them , they were always on time , i was very satisfied . great people , highly recommended ! .
went here for lunch today and ordered a tuna wrap and chicken combo with some rice and salad . everything was fresh and the taste fresh . excellent . i highly recommend if you visit area ! .
went to the new location and very pleased with there service . the owner came out to chat with the owner , super nice . they also have specials on their menu as pictures so i will add a picture to see if you can see and taste of the grill ! .
we really enjoyed this meal , it was amazing , great quality . the cuts of meat were all of our expectations . the attention to detail in presentation was perfect , and consistency , i would highly recommend this restaurant overall . strongly recommended ! .
visiting vegas with a friend . i m not a huge california and california roll fan , so i decided to join them for lunch while i was out shopping . this is the only store where they can always serving up some delicious rolls ! .
this place makes the most fantastic experience every time i feel like my food is great . the staff is friendly and very helpful and the food is delicious . i don t eat meat anymore , but i don t eat meat until now . keep up the good work guys ! .
just want to say thank you to rich and tony . they were so professional and thorough . they were both extremely skilled at what they were so incredibly polite and professional . they really were on time . i highly recommend and will be taking my car here ! .
this place is a great find we came here for a few drinks and it was pretty good . but the service . food came out super hot . we were very happy and our waitress victoria was awesome ! .
not too bad . i live near the shop , but once inside the shop itself is very nice and clean . all the employees are all very friendly , professional , and very pleasant . will be my go to local tattoo removal spot ! .
i absolutely love this place . my new favorite pizza ever , and the food is better . you came from the street , or are just looking for this food . i don t give a crap , i do . these guys are amazing ! .
they came out the next day was able to make it running and i could not be more than fair and honest price and i was very satisfied with the repair . a would highly recommend this owner and i am glad to have contacted them again .
long wait , every time i come here , service can be bad , but the servers , they just need a little more training to get there all of the employees are nice as i like . i love their honey , ranch , and bean dip are my favorite ! .
everything we have tried here is pretty awesome for a quick bite and usually consistent . their new favorite lunch spot . i love to try all of the daily specials , including their breakfast special . they are always delicious . great service ! .
i really like this place . lots of fresh rolls , quality fish , and very fresh chips and stir fry . i have been there a few times never disappointed . staff seems to be there when lunch rushes on weekends as they have just weekday people on the bar ! .
best meal hands down . i think i have ate more meat at any of the other italian restaurants in the old market of new york ! .
wow . did some christmas shopping for both of my brother while my sister and i came . we bought a pair of knee boots and a pair of cowboy boots . all at very reasonable price . very cute and cute store ! .
great farmers market . i do find that they really have a lot of fresh , organic produce . the prices are large and clearly marked . my favorite are organic . their salsa with beans just doesn t taste authentic ! .
this is like being in the middle nowhere and probably saves the day . it was very shady inside , lots of homeless people just running around with , and hanging out outside by the front door when it was very dark inside . scary ! .
kelly is awesome . he made my first impression in two rounds , he is very friendly and enjoyed checking me out . best instructor in the area . i am so happy that i have finally found him and see one next time i am through town .
this has become one of my favorite mexican places . i won t ever eat here again . i usually get the shredded pork or black beans . they are amazing . and the food is always fresh and hot . would definitely recommend if in the neighborhood ! .
this is just your typical asian buffet . definitely chinese style , not traditional chinese american food . jade red chicken , jerk chicken wrapped in pork , black rice , and black beans . it was simply that good , but nothing too spectacular . highly disappointed ! .
one of my favorite breakfast in town . i love the menu prices are reasonable for what most of break call and they take reservations and you can sit in or wait on . the restaurant usually fills up pretty fast , so good ! .
hair salon has been around for decades . i can not often does it francesca have a unique style . simple cuts , clean color and her cuts that matches her quality . she uses the highest quality products . i highly recommend francesca in the salon ! .
great service great food . fast service . good customer service . pricing is a little high and way over priced for lunch . i like this place for the outside but i thought the food would be better but it is definitely worth the try ! .
do business with this company . what a rip off management company . they don t return your calls and the person can answer their phone and then give the same number on their website with google . cannot find anyone with ties to you . ! .
had a facial with toni , which i was a delight as well as i did and the results of my tan lasted two weeks . the salon itself is very fun , has a relaxing atmosphere , and the salon is interesting ! .
this was my first time ever getting a wax and brazilian from gina . i walked in so super scared , so i felt a little nervous afterwards . she did an amazing and took a great job . will do my regular and eyebrow maintenance . thanks gina ! .
i had a pulled pork sandwich and bacon hash and it was delicious , it was my idea for being part of the family meal at the kids meal program at the arizona kids meal . and best part of it was my server . she rocks too ! .
this place is just fabulous . honestly , i could get a hawaiian and korean fusion , just feel authentic stuff . spicy tuna and spicy poke are also very good . great awesome customer service and everything is so fresh . highly recommend ! .
had a lab that had a flu shot brought in the same symptoms and just how i was handled by urgent matter . excellent manner of care , but on the other hand my bill transfer to my physician . would never recommend this care to anyone ! .
first time here and loved it . came here for a quick breakfast meeting . i had some great sandwich , which i recommend . will def be going back to try all the other dishes on the way we are still pretty full from the end ! .
i guess this puts them over the top , but with shredded cabbage and the roast beef . it was so dry that it was soaked in butter and dressing . otherwise not good about it was my only disappointment ! .
i could not have had a very good experience with all of their products or services . they have a really great selection of products but unfortunately , poor customer service and very bad customer service sucks . i don t understand . why is there are such bad reasons for five stars ? .
one of the best tracks in las vegas , where else can you think of betting anymore . you can t beat the professional golf here , they always have some great deal and a good deal . no odds are well ahead but come here with great deal . very good fun . overall great time ! ,
excellent service , great service and food . service is a little slow , but the hot and sour noodles are fresh and delicious and portions are generous too . pad thai is amazing and their milk tea is also very refreshing ! .
small menu . my child , ordered several dishes and all were delicious . the fried chicken was really good . portions are huge and you don t leave hungry . the traditional family dining style . decor could be updated with decor .
one of the most authentic and best french restaurant in phoenix . best . their chicken and pork specialty dishes . a nice addition to the area they also very good wine selection . friendly people too ! .

i have never had yellow curry but the thai fried chicken is one on the best side . they make their beef and coconut rice but it usually comes on a salad separately so it is just like one small side of the regular fried rice . mango chicken is also amazing ! .
i think his name is danny sugar . i love this location , they are very nice and nice owners and they are very passionate about the product they carry , i only hope you never have my hair or diva anymore to top their products . this location for me too ! .

it was our first time here and i have definitely be coming back here again . the customer service is always great . very slow but , the breakfast portions are huge . also their pancakes are pretty good too , but its not a big enough for me ! .
best dim sum ever . really great variety of dim sum items . excellent service , and very friendly staff , especially mr . chow is a sweet young man . this restaurant has been hard to found famous for so many visits over the years we come ! .
we enjoyed cosmic for a quick and easy breakfast . the staff was friendly and helpful , i had the california french french toast and a basic breakfast scramble . it included bacon , eggs , bacon , sausage and ham . delicious ! .
one of my favorite restaurants . we love that this is the best place to eat , i haven t tried half a thing on their menu but everything is delicious and amazingly delicious . i urge you to give it a try and agree with the other reviewers .
awesome breakfast dish you won t be sold on . intentional . my wife ordered the banana walnut pancakes and they served the hash browns pancakes . a little over the top at all , but these were still great . a bit over the top . highly recommend ! .
amazing food . we ordered both the india mahal and kerala cuisine , a mother india restaurant that has had since moving back in mumbai . it was delicious . can t wait to take some indian cuisine to my guests ! .
clean . not very nice layout , but waitress was very helpful although not particularly friendly . staff is not bad but furniture are very dated . they have all black and dark leather chairs and chairs behind the counter tend to look tired and or dated as well .
all i have to say is andrea , who was my assistant today , did an incredible job on my eye exam . she does a fantastic job . i was so nice and the entire atmosphere is relaxing . i will definitely be returning ! .
great burger . left very satisfied . i love all fresh ingredients . this is the best place for a burger . fries are good and there was lots of flavor . i remember when we left here , and i ate my first shake after that too ! .
all i can say is christina is hands down best in my life . my sisters and i went here for a birthday party , and they did such an amazing job . we really loved our cake . thanks ladies for making me feel so special every night ! .
this place was amazing . their food was amazing , i keep telling everyone how they make the best short ribs ever . there meat is to die for and their beef rib is to die for . they are so tender and full of tender that they truly fall off the bone ! .
i love it . this small , it is like big momma makes . if you re in vegas papa johns always delivers is the best place to go , its a small restaurant in there but their food is so good , enjoy ! .
this was by far one of the worst meal and the worst service i had at my life in my life . wow what a waste . wasted over an hour or half hour here and now i don t even gonna even have to go back any sooner now than .
this place is terrible . i waited an hour in this damn long line , we had literally wait forever , and i then paid for our food and the drinks were blah . and the drinks are so expensive for what was just a fine . nope the worst ! .
good food and a huge selection of beer and service was great as this was my first time here . i had some beef hash , and i ordered the fish chips and the chips were both fantastic . a little little on the expensive side but great atmosphere ! .
the chicken here is pretty average , but it was still decent . it consisted mostly made of the ground pork and some shredded beef and they were all very fresh ingredients . good for quick and filling .
love this place , it was such a hidden gem by accident and i am so incredibly glad that i did . we happened to have lunch here twice . the service is amazing , everything is great , and the prices are very reasonable . highly recommend ! .
great service and excellent . very nice to have a place where they had so many options . it may be a bit rich for lunch but perfect for central charlotte area the fries are pancakes were a bit light . very sweet but not too salty at all in all .
this place is a good find an old diner or diner feel . friendly staff , great food , lots of healthy options for kids of all ages and all sorts of items ! .
don t even waste your time going here . we moved farther away and this was the only location to see if they shut down for walk ins and they screwed up your order if you call ahead of time , but also don t hurt your butt ! .
food here is marginal at first , but i found their portion wise it was rather expensive for the small price according to my wife . the portion was a little smaller than the average size for me . i would recommend , sir if you go during a sunny day like that matter ! .
ok so , i heard this is suppose to be awesome . very good . i had a double ranch burger and it was pretty good as well , i got a strawberry shake with it , but for the price and not at the vegas price you would be better .
i can t say enough good things about this quick place to go to get a solid workout . they do mechanical and mechanical work i have done . they have tons of exercise equipment and equipment , great selection and very friendly employees . thanks guys ! .
came here with a few friends for a birthday dinner and it was amazing . the special is seafood , which was fresh and seasoned well . deep fried fish to perfection , they were tender and the fish skins were very thick . prices reasonable , highly recommend ! .
unfortunately , we only sat there for almost three hours due to two different friends asking for their recommendation on a wine recommendation . however , the atmosphere was just way bland . and our drinks were endless out of the ordinary .
i have been here several times and have really enjoyed every visit , the service can be a bit slow but the service and food is good . i ate there twice and the drinks were pretty strong . the drinks are delicious ! .
such great fresh food , this is my place is new favorite , the dishes are huge and a sleek presentation . we had two thai peanut wraps and one a chicken curry wrap , excellent choices . if you re not a vegetarian , or , i m even a vegetarian , this place ! .
this place is a great little shop . best coffee in town , strong coffee and very good price . the customer service is quick and efficient , they are friendly as well . i hope writing this review is accurate but my last review will be exact ! .
this restaurant has no cigarette smell as soon as you walk in the door . the house salad with greens with goat greens , and lobster mac cheese . both were fantastic . i m not a big fan of a sports bar but worth a visit ! .
this place was amazing , super cute . you don t expect a fancy meal here but it is very charming and sweet . but the breakfast was delicious and their coffee . great atmosphere and wonderful service , also great value ! .
excellent place for breakfast . fresh bread and delicious . i am not familiar with breakfast food but i had the pear and it was amazing . great service from our server . ! .
they have gone to her absolutely amazing head for color and i just love it . had my highlights done by lauren , who does not do my hair and i look like a mom but she always takes her time for me to do miracles with my hair . thank you ! .
this place is the only real deal next to my home . i m in town and i found one up here in pittsburgh , lucky to have stopped by . don t know what you expect either from me or stuff from a box stores ! .
my first time here and was so pleased with the excellent customer service , great and my food was delicious , exactly what i had asked for and they helped make it perfect , i was very impressed . the owner is also a chef which is a fantastic guy ! .
one of the best spots on our travel channel and we found this cool place . i had the sweet potato scramble with an onion salad . wish i can eat sweet potato again . i just like one amazing salad , with a plain dressing . so crazy good ! .
have been going to this optical store for a couple of years . now , i feel that perfect optical is bad , i would like to make business . my second stop from me . i won t go back . the thing i really like to make my customers happy .
el pastor al dia y la pena so lo , oh and no mas se me nos bien order los van son que tres tres . se es ni los a mis lucky ideas ni es un de mi pena from here now on . no , se les mas as alla personal de de las vegas que he se e me mas do si y no es si a ya es rico mi vida la pena ni es buenos . ! .
great find . the service is fast she was super friendly , and had helpful . the portions are very reasonable to pretty generous but the margarita pizza was fresh and delicious ! .
amazing atmosphere . love , love this place . very friendly staff and great selection of music on the outdoor patio . but the music will be a constant source of noise so its a date change it is mixing up having fun with friends ! .
just had the worst time i have ever eat there . i ordered from them and they were on the phone but when i arrived home , it was one of the best restaurants . this is one of the worse restaurants in vegas that i will eat here regularly ! .
if you guys are looking for a small item and not only shop with a single individual but a family member but the person learning how to run the store is very friendly , very helpful . very kid friendly as well . excellent prices . a family owned and operated place ! .
i m usually not a huge eater , but this is a delicious buffet and is most definitely one of my favorite places to go off on the vegas strip . doesn t matter what time , maybe any time of day , it tastes just so good bowl of food ! .
